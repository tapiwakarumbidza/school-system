# School Management System for Teachers and Principals

## Description
A **Visual Basic** application designed for managing school-related tasks for **Teachers** and **Principals**. Teachers can upload student grades and manage class schedules, while **Principals** oversee school-wide operations, manage teacher accounts, and generate reports. This system is built using **VB.NET** and **SQL Server** for backend data storage.

## Features
- **Role-Based Dashboards**:
  - **Teachers**: Upload grades, manage schedules.
  - **Principals**: Manage teacher accounts, view school-wide reports.
  
- **Secure Login**: 
  - Role-based authentication for teachers and principals.

- **Database Management**:
  - Store user information and grades using **SQL Server**.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: Visual Basic (VB.NET)
- **Backend**: SQL Server
- **Database**: MySQL or SQL Server

## Getting Started
Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
1. **Microsoft Visual Studio** (or any VB.NET compatible IDE)
2. **SQL Server** (or MySQL)
3. **SQL Server Management Studio** (optional but recommended for managing the database)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/school-management-system.git
   ```

2. **Set up the database**:
   Run the SQL script from `/Database/SchoolDB.sql` to create the required tables and insert sample data.

3. **Open the project**:
   Open the project in **Microsoft Visual Studio**.

4. **Configure the database connection**:
   Update the connection string in the project to match your local database setup. 
   Example:
   ```vb
   Dim con As New SqlConnection("Data Source=localhost;Initial Catalog=SchoolDB;Integrated Security=True")
   ```

5. **Run the application**:
   Press **F5** to build and run the application.

## Database Schema
The system requires a database with two primary tables:

1. **Users**:
   - Stores user details and roles (Teacher/Principal).
2. **Grades**:
   - Stores student grades associated with teachers.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Users (
    UserID INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    Name VARCHAR(100),
    Email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
    PasswordHash VARCHAR(255),
    Role ENUM('Teacher', 'Principal') NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE Grades (
    GradeID INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    StudentName VARCHAR(100),
    Subject VARCHAR(100),
    Grade CHAR(2),
    TeacherID INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (TeacherID) REFERENCES Users(UserID)
);
```

## Usage
- **Login**: Log in as either a Teacher or Principal. The system will redirect you to the appropriate dashboard based on your role.
- **Teacher Dashboard**: Upload student grades and manage schedules.
- **Principal Dashboard**: Manage teacher accounts and view school-wide reports.
